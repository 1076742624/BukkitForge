Bukkit4Vanilla - a Minecraft mod that ports the Bukkit plugin API to minecraft.

This is very WIP. Since i started doing this, i was mostly aiming for a server that didn't crash.

It can load plugins, it can run (very simple) ones, but not much more.

I'm working on fixing compatibility - I have a roadmap of plugins to get working, in ROADMAP.

Most of this mod is a fairly straight port from Craftbukkit, but I've had to modify parts
(and i anticipate modifiying more).

GETTING IT WORKING IN MCP:
After unzipping the forge source, copy bukkit_at.cfg to forge/common (if that's where forges ATs are).
decompile as usual. There are __two__ fields from which you must remove the 'final' declaration - one is
CraftingManager.instance, i cant remeber the other one.

LICENSE:

This mod is licensed under the LGPL, the same as Craftbukkit.
