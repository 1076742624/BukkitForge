=head1 Bukkit4Vanilla - a Minecraft mod that ports the Bukkit plugin API to minecraft.
 
This is very WIP. Since i started doing this, i was mostly aiming for a server that didn't crash.
It can load plugins, it can run (very simple) ones, but not much more.
I'm working on fixing compatibility - I have a roadmap of plugins to get working, in ROADMAP.

Most of this mod is a fairly straight port from Craftbukkit, but I've had to modify parts
(and i anticipate modifiying more).

This is the mod as it was when 1.4 was released.

=head1 GETTING IT WORKING IN MCP:
 
After unzipping the forge source, copy bukkit_at.cfg to forge/accesstransformers (create the folder if it's not there).
decompile as usual. 

=head1 LICENSE:
 
This mod is licensed under the LGPL, the same as Craftbukkit.
