Bukkit4Vanilla - a Minecraft mod that ports the Bukkit plugin API to minecraft.

This is very WIP. Since i started doing this, i was mostly aiming for a server that didn't crash.

It can load plugins, it can run (very simple) ones, but not much more.

I'm working on fixing compatibility - I have a roadmap of plugins to get working, in ROADMAP.

Most of this mod is a fairly straight port from Craftbukkit, but I've had to modify parts
(and i anticipate modifiying more).

This mod is licensed under the LGPL, the same as Craftbukkit.
